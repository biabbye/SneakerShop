# SneakerShop
SneakerShop is a demo React Native application for one of the university courses, made with Expo, that acts like an online sneaker shop. It uses AsyncStorage for all the operations required, such as managing the registration of a new user and the login process of the user, adding a product to the user's cart and also deleting them one by one.
